Hi, WorldKrysis (Krystian). 
I saw in HolographicWings totk mod repo that you posted your performance, and it was great, I am having trouble with bad stutter and low fps, although I have a very similar setup, could you please share with me your yuzu settings and what mods you have active in the game? I would really appreciate it. Thanks.
